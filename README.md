# Introduction
 Welcome to Code Platoon's Quickpass Program!  This repository contains all the files and information you need to complete QuickPass and start your coding education journey!

 ## Viewing Course Files

 You can view and/or download the course files in several ways:
 
 1. GitHub offers a comprehensive preview window and it is possible to see the Jupyter Notebook files as well as the PDF versions right there in the viewer.
 2. You can download individual files with GitHub by clicking the file you want and downloading the raw file.  You can view PDFs with the PDF reader of your choice and you can open local HTML files with your browser.
 3. If you are a bit familiar with GitHub and running code, you can fork this repo to your personal GitHub account and run the code however you want.

 Please see the `0-Pre-course` lesson to view the pre-course information.  It will assist you with course setup and contains all of the background information & resources you need to start your coding journey!
