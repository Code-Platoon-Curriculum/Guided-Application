    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### a. for i in x (for element in iterable)\n",

    "urls = [\"www.reddit.com\", \"www.nike.com\", \"www.codeplatoon.org\", \"www.amazon.com]\n",
    "for url in urls:\n",
    "    print(url)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case:** This loop iterates through the elements of a list or any iterable. It's suitable when you want to perform the same operation for each item in the iterable. In this case, it's used to print each website URL."

    "for i in range(1, 6, 2):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case:** The `for i in range` loop is used when you need to iterate a specific number of times, often with a loop counter (`i`) that increments by a constant value (`step`). It's useful for tasks where you need to control the number of iterations and when you don't necessarily need to access elements in a collection."
