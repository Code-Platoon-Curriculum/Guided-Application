A Python program will give you an error if you try to execute an arithmetic function between the two.  Try it out below:"

    "The most basic data type in Python, booleans serve the most important role when it comes to writing a computer program: It allows a program to know what to do.  A boolean is binary.  It is yes or no, on or off, 1 or 0, `True` or `False`.  While this is an easy concept on its own, it will still take some practice to plan out how you are going to use booleans to construct a useful script that will do what you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "While you will sometimes explictly define a variable as a boolean value, booleans are typically used in comparison operators where the result of a boolean expression is what you're looking at to allow your program to make decisions.  For example, in a theoretical program of a thermostat, you can set the `current_temperature` to the output of the thermometer and your thermostat program can periodically evaluate the temperature against a set threshold to switch the heater or air conditioning on or off.  So you could write code that looks like this:"
