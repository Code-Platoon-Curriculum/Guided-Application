    "Welcome to the lesson on Python basic concepts and problem-solving strategies for Python developers. in this lesson, we are going to introduce some of the features and concepts of the Python language. In addition, we will go over the strategies that we use as developers to effectively produce solutions. Problem-solving is a fundamental skill. Whether you're building web applications, data analysis tools, or machine learning models, you'll encounter complex problems that require creative and effective solutions. This foundational lesson will be a framework designed to change the way to think about a problem."

A variable name in Python will typically be a lowercase word or series of words separated by the underscore character (`_`).
