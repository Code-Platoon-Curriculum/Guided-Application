## 1. Introduction to Algorithm Complexity (20 minutes)

### What is Algorithm Complexity?

- Algorithm complexity refers to the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of time and space.
- It assesses how an algorithm's performance scales with input size.

### Why Does It Matter?

- Efficient algorithms are essential for fast and scalable applications.
- Suboptimal algorithms can lead to slow or unusable software.

### Common Measures of Algorithmic Efficiency

- Execution time (time complexity).
- Memory usage (space complexity).
- CPU and memory constraints in real-world applications.

## 2. Big-O Notation (20 minutes)

### What is Big-O Notation?

- Big-O notation describes the upper bound of an algorithm's growth.
- It provides a simplified way to compare algorithms' performance.

### How to Calculate Big-O

- Counting operations and their growth rate.
- Examples: O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2).

In this section, we will explore various examples of Python code snippets that demonstrate different Big-O notations. Understanding these notations will help you analyze the efficiency of algorithms.

## O(1): Constant Time

O(1) denotes constant time complexity, where the execution time or memory consumption remains constant, regardless of the input size.

**Example:**

```python
def constant_time(arr):
    return arr[0]

element = constant_time([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
```

In this example, the `constant_time` function retrieves the first element of the input list. The time it takes to access the first element is constant, regardless of the list's size. Thus, the time complexity is O(1).

## O(log n): Logarithmic Time

O(log n) represents logarithmic time complexity, where the time or space consumption grows slowly as the input size increases.

**Example:**

```python
def binary_search(sorted_list, target):
    left, right = 0, len(sorted_list) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if sorted_list[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif sorted_list[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1

result = binary_search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 5)
```

The `binary_search` function demonstrates O(log n) complexity. As the input list size increases, the number of iterations required to find the target element grows logarithmically, making it efficient for large datasets.

## O(n): Linear Time

O(n) signifies linear time complexity, where the time or space consumption scales linearly with the input size.

**Example:**

```python
def linear_sum(arr):
    total = 0
    for num in arr:
        total += num
    return total

sum_result = linear_sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
```

In the `linear_sum` function, we sum up all the elements in the input list. As the list grows in size, the number of operations required to calculate the sum increases linearly.

## O(n log n): Linearithmic Time

O(n log n) describes linearithmic time complexity, commonly found in efficient sorting algorithms.

**Example:**

```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr

    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left_half = merge_sort(arr[:mid])
    right_half = merge_sort(arr[mid:])

    return merge(left_half, right_half)

def merge(left, right):
    result = []
    left_idx, right_idx = 0, 0

    while left_idx < len(left) and right_idx < len(right):
        if left[left_idx] < right[right_idx]:
            result.append(left[left_idx])
            left_idx += 1
        else:
            result.append(right[right_idx])
            right_idx += 1

    result.extend(left[left_idx:])
    result.extend(right[right_idx:])

    return result

sorted_list = merge_sort([4, 3, 7, 1, 9, 2, 5, 6, 8])
```

In the `merge_sort` function, we perform a merge sort on an input list. Merge sort has an average and worst-case time complexity of O(n log n), making it efficient for sorting large datasets.

## O(n^2): Quadratic Time

O(n^2) represents quadratic time complexity, where the time or space consumption grows quadratically with the input size.

**Example:**

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]

sorted_list = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]
bubble_sort(sorted_list)
```

The `bubble_sort` function demonstrates O(n^2) time complexity. It requires nested loops, leading to a significant increase in the number of operations as the input size grows.
