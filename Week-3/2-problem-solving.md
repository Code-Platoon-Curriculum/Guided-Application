## 1. Understanding the Problem (15 minutes)

### Problem Statement Analysis

- Understand the problem statement thoroughly.
- Identify input, output, and expected behavior.
- Clarify ambiguities and constraints.
- Create an example or use case to illustrate the problem.

### Identifying Constraints and Requirements

- Identify constraints on time, memory, or other resources.
- Consider special requirements or edge cases.
- Understand the problem's context and potential real-world impact.

## 2. Decomposition (15 minutes)

### Breaking Down Complex Problems

- Divide complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts.
- Define the main components of the problem.
- Prioritize subproblems and plan your approach.

### Identifying Relevant Data and Processes

- Determine what data and operations are required to solve each subproblem.
- Sketch a high-level plan of how subproblems interact.
- Visualize the problem structure.

## 3. Algorithm Design (20 minutes)

### Selecting Appropriate Data Structures

- Choose the right data structures to represent problem components.
- Evaluate the trade-offs of different data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets, etc.).
- Optimize data access and manipulation.

### Creating Algorithms to Solve Subproblems

- Design algorithms for each subproblem.
- Use pseudocode or flowcharts to outline your approach.
- Optimize the efficiency of your algorithms.

## 4. Coding and Debugging (20 minutes)

### Translating Your Algorithm into Python Code

- Follow Python coding conventions (PEP 8).
- Use meaningful variable names and comments.

### Strategies for Debugging and Troubleshooting

- Apply debugging techniques (print statements, debugging tools).
- Handle exceptions and errors gracefully.
- Fix issues systematically.

## 5. Testing and Validation (15 minutes)

### Writing Test Cases and Unit Tests

- Create comprehensive test cases to validate your code.
- Cover typical and edge cases.
- Use testing libraries (e.g., unittest) when appropriate.

### Validating Your Solution for Correctness and Efficiency

- Verify that your solution produces the expected outputs.
- Measure and analyze your code's efficiency.
- Profile code for bottlenecks.

## 6. Optimization (15 minutes)

### Analyzing Code for Performance Bottlenecks

- Profile your code to identify performance bottlenecks.
